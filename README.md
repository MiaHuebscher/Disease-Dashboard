# Disease-Dashboard
This code produces a dashboard containing disease prediction and disease information reporting capabilities. With this dashboard, users can input symptoms they might be experiencing and utilize a machine learning model of their choice (Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Logistic Regression) to receive a prediction of the disease they might have. Along with this prediction, users will receive a list of precautions to take given their predicted disease and a warning to consult a doctor before any serious actions are taken. 


In this dashboard, users can also see visualizations that report disease data across the United States.
